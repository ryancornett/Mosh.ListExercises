Note: For any of these exercises, ignore input validation unless otherwise directed.
Assume the user enters values in the format that the program expects.

Write a program and ask the user to enter 5 numbers.
If a number has been previously entered, display an error message and ask the user to re-try.
Once the user successfully enters 5 unique numbers, sort them and display the result on the console.
